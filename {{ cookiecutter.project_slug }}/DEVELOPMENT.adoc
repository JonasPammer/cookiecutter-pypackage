[[development-dependencies]]
=== üìå Development Dependencies
Development Dependencies are defined in a
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files[pip requirements file]
named `requirements-dev.txt`.
Example Installation Instructions for Linux are shown below:

----
# "optional": create a python virtualenv and activate it for the current shell session
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Automatic Tests are run on each Contribution using GitHub Workflows.

To run the tests yourself, simply run `tox` on the command line.

[[versioning]]
=== üî¢ Versioning

Versions are defined using https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging[Tags] which start with `v`.

When a new tag is pushed,
https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/actions/workflows/release-to-pypi.yml[a GitHub CI workflow]
(image:https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/actions/workflows/release-to-pypi.yml/badge.svg[Release CI])
takes care of building the wheels using
https://pypi.org/project/build/[build]
and uploading them to PyPI using
https://pypi.org/project/twine/[twine].

Version Bumps shall be made through the use of
https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version[`bump2version`], e.g.:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ *bump2version patch*
or
$ *bump2version minor*
or
$ *bump2version major*
----

This tool automatically updates the version string in the required files
and creates a generic commit with a matching tag
(as configured in `.bumpversion.cf`).

[NOTE]
====
Do not forget that _just_ git push'ing does not push tags!
Use:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ *git push origin <tag_name>*
or
$ *git push origin $(git describe --match "v*")*

This Project shall be kept in sync with
https://github.com/JonasPammer/cookiecutter-pypackage[the CookieCutter it was originally templated from]
using https://github.com/cruft/cruft[cruft] (if possible) or manual alteration (if needed)
to the best extend possible.

When a new tag is pushed, an appropriate GitHub Release will be created
by the Repository Maintainer to provide a proper human change log with a title and description.


[[pre-commit]]
=== ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Linting and Styling Conventions
General Linting and Styling Conventions are
https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/20/linters-arent-in-your-way-theyre-on-your-side/[*automatically* held up to Standards]
by various https://pre-commit.com/[`pre-commit`] hooks, at least to some extend.

Automatic Execution of pre-commit is done on each Contribution using
https://pre-commit.ci/[`pre-commit.ci`]<<note_pre-commit-ci,*>>.
Pull Requests even automatically get fixed by the same tool,
at least by hooks that automatically alter files.

[NOTE]
====
Not to confuse:
Although some pre-commit hooks may be able to warn you about script-analyzed flaws in syntax or even code to some extend (for which reason pre-commit's hooks are *part of* the test suite),
pre-commit itself does not run any real Test Suites.
For Information on Testing, see <<testing>>.
====

[TIP]
====
[[note_pre-commit-ci]]
Nevertheless, I recommend you to integrate pre-commit into your local development workflow yourself.

This can be done by cd'ing into the directory of your cloned project and running `pre-commit install`.
Doing so will make git run pre-commit checks on every commit you make,
aborting the commit themselves if a hook alarm'ed.

You can also, for example, execute pre-commit's hooks at any time by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.
